# Adding a Payment Processor to Pay

Each payment processor requires implementation of several things:

* Billable
* PaymentMethods
* Charge
* Subscription
* Webhooks

Pay instantiates Payment Processor classes to implement the API requests to the payment processor.

For example, a `Pay::Charge.refund!` will look up the payment processor (Stripe, for example) and instantiate `Pay::Stripe::Charge` with the `Pay::Charge` record. It will then call `refund!` allowing `Pay::Stripe::Charge` to handle the `refund` API request.

Each payment processor needs to implement the same classes in order to fulfill the hooks for making API requests.

We recommend copying FakeProcessor as the basis for your new payment processor and replacing each method with the appropriate API requests.

## Webhook Controller

Each payment processer can define it's own controller for processing any required webhooks.

For example, `stripe` has [app/controllers/pay/webhooks/stripe_controller.rb](../../app/controllers/pay/webhooks/stripe_controller.rb)

See also [config/routes.rb](../../config/routes.rb) for defining routes.

The webhook controller is responsible for verifying the webhook payload for authenticity and then sending to the Pay Webhook Delegator

### Pay Webhook Delegator

The Webhook Delegator is responsible for taking an event type and sending it for processing.

It uses [ActiveSupport::Notifications](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/Notifications.html) to subscribe and instrument events.

```ruby
Pay::Webhooks.configure do |events|
  events.subscribe "stripe.charge.succeeded", Pay::Stripe::Webhooks::ChargeSucceeded.new
end

module Pay
  module Stripe
    module Webhooks
      class ChargeSucceeded
        def call(event)
          # processing goes here
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

For example, when a `stripe.charge.succeeded` event gets processed, the webhook delegator sends the event to any classes that are subscribed to the event type.

Internally, these events are automatically prefaced with the `pay` namespace so they don't conflict with other events. `stripe.charge.succeeded` is internally routed as `pay.stripe.charge.succeeded`. Payment processors should _not_ preface with `pay.` as it is automatically added.
