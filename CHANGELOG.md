### Unreleased

* Add new configuration option named `send_emails` which can be used to disable the sending of all current and future emails.
  This option can be set to a boolean value or a proc/lambda that returns a boolean value. - @cjilbert504

### 6.4.0

* Introduce `:pay` load hook - @excid3
  Rails no longer allows autoloading during the initialization process. The on_load hook allows you to run code after autoloading, so we can register webhook listeners once autoloading is available.

  To use this, wrap your webhook subscribe calls in the `on_load(:pay)` hook:

  ```ruby
    ActiveSupport.on_load(:pay) do
      Pay::Webhooks.delegator.subscribe "stripe.charge.succeded", ChargeSucceeded
    end
  ```

### 6.3.4

* Import Stimulus.js from dist folder on unpkg

### 6.3.3

* Fix `swap_and_invoice`
* Support passing options through `swap` on Stripe

### 6.3.2

* [SECURITY] Fix XSS vulnerability in back parameter on Stripe payment page
  Previously, an attacker could inject Javascript or redirect the user to any URL by changing the `back` parameter in the URL.
  The `back` parameter is now sanitized and restricted to relative paths.
* Remove unused attributes for `plan` and `quantity` in `app/models/pay/customer.rb`.
* Add explicit requires for `active_support` and `action_mailer` in `lib/pay.rb`. This should provide better errors for anyone not requiring all of Rails.

### 6.3.1

* Fix `retry_past_due_subscriptions` to now call `pay_open_invoices`

### 6.3.0

* Add `payment_failed` email to notify customers of failed payments and update their billing information
  This can be disabled with `Pay.emails.payment_failed = true` if you already use a dunning email service
* `subscription` now sorts by `created_at` to find the latest subscription. This adds compatibility for UUID primary keys on pay tables.
* Add `unpaid` scope to Pay::Subscription
* Add `pay_open_invoices` to Pay::Stripe::Subscription
  If you have a subscription with open invoices (like an unpaid metered billing subscription), you can use this method to pay the open invoices and allow the user to resume the subscription

### 6.2.4

* Set `created_at` on Braintree charges to match transaction created_at
* Sync Braintree payment method during subscription sync since we already have to look it up
* Handle missing Braintree subscription when syncing charge
* Fix `Pay::Charge.payment_processor` scopes to join the customers table

### 6.2.3

* Fix Braintree PaymentMethod sync reference to gateway

### 6.2.2

* Fix `pause_active?` for stripe incorrectly returning `true`
* Refactor Braintree cancel / cancel_now to use sync

### 6.2.1

* Use `paid_through_date` for `ends_at` with canceled subscriptions

### 6.2.0

* Add `Pay::Braintree::Subscription.sync`
* Add `Pay::Braintree::Charge.sync`
* Switch Braintree webhooks to use `sync`
* Automatically save first charge when subscribing with Braintree
* Add `email` for PayPal charges and `username` for Venmo charges on Braintree

### 6.1.2

* Fix `refunds` missing on checkout session completed event.

### 6.1.1

* Cast `Pay.support_email` to `Mail::Address` instead of string. This allows us to easily parse out the address, name, etc for use in Receipts and other places.
* Update Stripe `checkout_session.completed` webhook to sync `latest_charge` for compatibility with Stripe API `2022-11-15` changes

### 6.1.0

* Swapping Braintree subscriptions previously had a bug where if a user had an existing plan and was attempting to switch to a new plan, we would cancel their current plan before subscribing them to the new plan.
  If subscribing to the new plan failed however, the user would then no longer have any plan at all. This has now been resolved by attempting to subscribe to the new plan first, which if fails will raise an error and
  preserve the users current plan.
* Switch `business_name` to `application_name` to receipt & mailers
  The business name is included on receipts & refunds, but emails should show the `application_name` instead in case a business has multiple applications / products
* Use `instance_exec` for `mail_arguments` and `mail_to` so lambda/proc has access to all mailer features
* Add `application_name` to email subjects
* Add links to root_url in emails

### 6.0.3

* Validate PaymentIntent on `swap` and `retry_failed_payment`

### 6.0.2

* Retrieve PaymentIntent via API to ensure it always matches the Pay Stripe API verison

### 6.0.1

* Handle ActiveRecord::RecordNotUnique error during sync and retry
* Add retries to Stripe PaymentMethod.sync
* Fix deprecation warning in tests #735

### 6.0.0

* [Breaking] Require Stripe 8.x
* [Breaking] Update Stripe API to 2022-11-15
* [Breaking] `paddle_paused_from` is now `pause_starts_at:datetime` column
* [Breaking] `active` scope no longer includes paused subscriptions
* [Breaking] Stripe paused subscriptions have changed:
  `pause_behavior=void` subscriptions are now considered `active?` until the end of the current period. This is intended for not providing services for a certain period of time.
  `pause_behavior=mark_uncollectible` is considered active. This is intended for offering services for free.
  `pause_behavior=keep_as_draft` is considered active. This is intended for offering serivces for free but collecting payments later.
* [Breaking] Stripe subscriptions now `always_invoice` when swapping plans. Previously, swap would use `proration_behavior: "create_prorations"`. This caused some confusion when users upgraded plans and weren't charged until the next period. The default will now automatically invoice immediately.
* Adds `pause_behavior:string` column
* Adds `pause_resumes_at:datetime` column
* Adds `metered:boolean` column for easier querying / indexing
* Adds `active_or_paused` scope to retrieve active or paused subscriptions
* Remove `off_session: true` default for Stripe `subscribe`. - @excid3
  Removing this allows Stripe to attach the PaymentMethod to the Customer once confirmed. You can still pass this option in when subscribing if needed. New subscriptions typically are initiated by users, which shouldn't provide this parameter as true.
* Add `Pay::Stripe::PaymentMethod.sync_payment_intent` to sync PaymentMethod from PaymentIntent objects
* Add `Pay::Stripe::PaymentMethod.sync_setup_intent` to sync PaymentMethod from SetupIntent objects
* Add `Pay::Subscription#retry_failed_payment` for retrying `past_due` subscriptions with failed payments
* Fix `swap` from always setting status to `active`. Failed swaps with Stripe will be set to `past_due`.

### 5.0.4

* Prepend Pay webhook listeners so they run before user-defined webhook listeners - @excid3 @cjilbert504
  This is important because a user might define a webhook listener that expects a subscription to be deleted and if the Pay webhook hasn't run yet, the subscription would not be canceled when the user-defined webhook runs.
* Fix Webhook delegator unsubscribe - @excid3 @cjilbert504

* Fix non-deterministic subscription - @feliperaul @excid3

### 5.0.3

* Old Pay::Subscription records may have `nil` or `[]` for subscription_items. In those cases, we will set the quantity on the Stripe Subscription directly - @excid3

### 5.0.2

* Add `metered_subscription_item` to Pay::Subscriptions to easily retrieve the metered subscription item for Stripe subscriptions - @excid3
* Add `not_fake_processor` scope to Pay::Customer - @excid3

### 5.0.1

* Fix typo in Stripe API version - @excid3

### 5.0.0

* Upgrade to Stripe API `2022-08-01` and `stripe` rubygem v7 - @excid3

### 4.2.1

* Ensure Customer is created before creating a setup intent - @excid3 @cjilbert504

### 4.2.0

* ℹ️  Add `"paused"` into `.active` scope and `#active?` on `Pay::Subscription`.
    Stripe marks paused subscriptions with `status: :active` and  `pause_behavior` not null.
    Paddle marks paused subscriptions with `status: :paused`.
    This change allows Pay to treat them both the same. - @cjilbert504 @excid3
* Add `active_without_paused` scope on `Pay::Subsctiption`. This filters out paused subscriptions from the `active` scope. - @cjilbert504 @GALTdea
* Add `status: :paused` to update call in `Pay::Paddle::Subscription#pause`. - @cjilbert504 @excid3
* Change `#paused?` in `Pay::Paddle::Subscription` to check `pay_subscription.status == "paused"` instead of `#paddle_paused_from`. - @cjilbert504 @excid3
    If webhooks have not been utilized, you should run query for any `Pay::Subscriptions` where `status: :active` and `paddle_paused_from` is not null and update to `status: "paused"`.

### 4.1.1

* Expand Stripe discounts and taxes when loading a subscription - @excid3

### 4.1.0

* Store Stripe refunds on the Charge - @excid3
* Include line for each refund in the receipt - @excid3

### 4.0.4

* Fix recording first charge for a subscription - @excid3

### 4.0.3

* Fix tax amounts and skip $0 tax lines in Stripe receipts - @excid3

### 4.0.2

* Support `client_reference_id` on Stripe Checkout Sessions - @excid3 @cjilbert504
  This is helpful when using the Stripe Pricing Table or any Checkout Session. Requires a Signed GlobalID as the value to prevent tampering.

```ruby
::Stripe::Checkout::Session.create(
  mode: "payment",
  client_reference_id: current_user.to_sgid,
  ...
)
```

* Stripe `checkout.session.completed` now syncs payment intents - @excid3

### 4.0.1

* Update `refund!` method in `stripe/charge.rb` to handle multiple refunds on the same charge. - @cjilbert504 @kyleschmolze
* Add configuration options for mailer - @excid3 @le-doude @cjilbert504

```ruby
Pay.setup do |config|
  # Change parent mailer for Pay::UserMailer
  config.parent_mailer = "MyCustomMailer"

  # Change the mailer for Pay
  config.mailer = "MyCustomMailer"
```

### 4.0.0

* [Breaking] Replaced `subscription` and `charge` email params to `pay_subscription` and `pay_charge` respectively. - @cjilbert504
* [Breaking] Replaced `send_emails` with `emails` config. This allows you to customize which emails can be sent independently. - @cjilbert504
```ruby
Pay.setup do |config|
  # Set value to boolean
  config.emails.receipt = true
  # Or set value to a lambda that returns a boolean
  config.emails.subscription_renewing = ->(pay_subscription, price) {
    (price&.type == "recurring") && (price.recurring&.interval == "year")
  }
end
```

* Numericality validation on `Pay::Subscription` has been updated from being `greater_than_or_equal_to: 1` to `greater_than_or_equal_to: 0`. This is because metered billing subscriptions do not have a quantity.

* Stripe Tax support

  Using `pay_customer stripe_attributes: :method_name`, you can add an Address to `Stripe::Customer` objects which will be used for calculating taxes.
  We now record `total_tax_amounts` to `Pay::Charge` records. This includes details for each tax applied to the charge.

  ```ruby
  @user.payment_processor.subscribe(plan: "growth", automatic_tax: { enabled: true })
  ```

* Stripe Metered Billing support
  Removes `quantity` when creating a new subscription (metered billing prices do not allow quantity)
  Adds `create_usage_record` to `Pay::Subscription` for reporting usage on metered billing plans
  Adds `metered_items?` helper to `Pay::Subscription` to easily check if a subscription has any metered billing items
  Adds `Pay::Subscription.with_metered_items` method to query for subscriptions with metered billing items

* Raise error when dependencies are not supported versions. This makes sure you're using supported versions of libraries with Pay.
  Currently supported versions:
    * `stripe ~> 6.0`
    * `braintree ~> 4.7`
    * `paddle_pay ~> 0.2`
    * `receipts ~> 2.0`
* Add `credit_note!` to Stripe charges - @excid3
* `refund!` now issues a Stripe::CreditNote if an invoice is present - @excid3
  > Refunds of charges associated with an Invoice don’t reduce your overall tax liability and don’t show up in Stripe Tax reporting. https://stripe.com/docs/tax/faq#how-do-refunds-work
  > In most cases, you should use credit notes instead of refunds. Credit notes reduce your overall tax liability and show up in Stripe Tax reporting. https://stripe.com/docs/tax/faq#how-do-you-handle-credit-notes
* Stripe.max_network_retries is now set to 2 by default. - @excid3
  This adds idempotency keys automatically to each request so that they can be safely retried.
* Stripe Subscriptons can now be paused and resumed - @excid3
* Separate authorize and capture is now supported on Stripe - @excid3
  ```ruby
  pay_charge = pay_customer.authorize(75_00)
  pay_charge.capture
  pay_charge.capture(amount_to_capture: 50_00) # or with an amount
  ```

Stripe API 2020-08-27 changes:

  Requires adding `owner_type:string` to both Pay::Charge and Pay::Subscription models and setting the value for all existing records to your model name.

class AddOwnerTypeToPay < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.0]
  def change
    add_column :pay_charges, :owner_type, :string
    add_column :pay_subscriptions, :owner_type, :string

    # Backfill owner_type column to match your Billable model
    Pay::Charge.update_all owner_type: "User"
    Pay::Subscription.update_all owner_type: "User"
  end
end
```

  `Pay.billable_class` is now deprecated and will be removed in a future version. You should also update your existing Pay migrations to reference the `:users` table rather than `Pay.billable_class` and any other code you may have that references this method.
